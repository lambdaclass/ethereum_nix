# Nix Ethereum
Nix flakes and NixOS modules for the Ethereum ecosystem.

### Nix
We provide Nix flakes for quickly deploying Ethereum execution and consensus clients in a reproducible and declarative manner.

#### Execution clients
- go-ethereum

### NixOS
Our NixOS configuration files simplify setting up an Ethereum validator node on NixOS, currently supporting **Geth + Lighthouse** on any network. Additionally, we offer built-in **monitoring** with Grafana and Loki.

### Usage
To spin up a terminal with **geth**, run the following command:
```
nix run github:lambdaclass/ethereum_nix
```

### Project Status ðŸš§
This project is a work in progress. Some configurations are currently hardcoded or untidy, but we are actively improving flexibility. 
Future updates will expand support to additional execution and consensus client combinations, including Ethrex.

- [x] Test on MacOS
- [ ] Test on Linux
- [ ] Add more execution clients
- [ ] Add more consensus clients
