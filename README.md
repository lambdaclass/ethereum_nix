# Nix and Ethereum

This repo provides scripts for deploying Ethereum execution and consensus clients on NixOS.

Currently supported:  
- **Geth + Lighthouse**  
- **Erigon with its internal consensus client**

We also provide scripts for setting up **Geth + Lighthouse** as a validator on the **Holesky** testnet (and soon on **Hoodi** and **Mainnet**).  

This project is still a work in progress, and some values are currently hardcoded. We are actively improving flexibility and expanding support for additional execution and consensus client combinations, including Nethermind and Prysm.
